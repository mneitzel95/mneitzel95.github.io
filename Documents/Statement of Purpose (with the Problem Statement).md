Problem Statement
--------------------
---
If there was a program that allows people to highlight specific text from a video slide presentation, they would be able to use that text in their own notes so that they can view them later on.  People want to interact with the content of a video presentation more directly by creating a system to record and playback video-like content with the semantic meaning intact via HTML will meet this need.  Ideally, users will be able to interact with the content of a  “video” presentation by copying text, clicking on links, and answer prompts for information (e.g., questions check understanding).  However, the semantic meaning and structure of content is lost during the usual video recording process, which only captures a sequence of images.  The demand for these features in education is apparent based on decisions with fellow students and teachers.  YouTube provides partial support for these features through “cards”, captions, and description links, which indicates that these features are helpful.  With the use of Reveal.js and Visual Studio Code I will be able to design a way for people to be able to review the notes as they were presented in the slides by being able to copy and paste the exact text from the slides into their own notes.
