Research
--------------------

<p>
I will complete my project by doing some research on how to use Reveal.js and all of the features that it involves and how to use the Visual Studio Code Storyteller Plugin 
and all of the features that are involved with it.  Another feature that I need to do some research on is identifying ways to add audio to a Storyteller file in Visual 
Studio Code.  One way that I can accomplish this is by using the Chronicler extension in Visual Studio Code.  Another way that I can accomplish this is by possibly using 
Audacity and importing the recorded audio file into the Storyteller file.

<!--Background
--------------------

<p>
People want to interact with the content of a recorded video presentation more directly if the recording included the semantic structure of the content rather than just raster 
images.  For example, viewers may copy and paste the text from the slides, clicking on links, giving feedback, and jumping to logical segments.  By creating a system to record 
and playback video-like content and audio playback with the semantic meaning intact via HTML will meet this need.  The implementation will include adding features to a recorded 
video presentation with audio playback such as copy and paste text from the slides, clicking on links, giving feedback, and jumping to logical segments.  The video presentation 
is going to record audio and video for later playback with the use of the audio-slideshow reveal.js plugin by rajgoel on GitHub.
