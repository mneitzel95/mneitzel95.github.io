Project Implementation Description & Explanation
--------------------
---
<p>
- People want to interact with the content of a recorded video presentation more directly if the recording included the semantic structure of the content rather than just 
raster images.
</p>
<p>
- For example, viewers may copy and paste the text from the slides, click on links, give feedback, and jump to logical segments.
</p>
<p>
- By creating a system to record and playback video-like content and audio playback with the semantic meaning intact via HTML will meet this need.
</p>
<p>
- The implementation will include adding features to a recorded video presentation with audio playback such as copy and paste text from the slides, clicking on links, 
giving feedback, and jumping to logical segments.
</p>
<p>
- The video presentation is going to record audio and video for later playback with the use of the audio-slideshow reveal.js plugin by rajgoel on GitHub.
